    <p>The <a href="https://www.daisy.com/nationals">2023 Daisy National BB Gun Championship Match</a> is set for July 6 through 9 at the Rogers Arkansas Convention Center.</p>

    <div class="body-extra">
        <p><b>-Safety Counts</b></p>
        <p>At the Daisy Nationals, a written safety test, covering information contained in the classroom curriculum, comprises a substantial percentage of each competitor's final score. Often a top score is decided not only based on shooting ability but on the competitor's knowledge of gun safety and resulting test score.</p>

        <p><b>-On the Road to the Daisy Nationals</b></p>
        <p>Qualifying for the Daisy National BB Gun Championship Match takes practice, hard work, dedication and resourcefulness. Coaches begin with weekly classes of boys and girls, ages 8 to 15. Only when the classes have completed lessons on gun safety and proper handling will they progress to the airgun range. They form their five-member teams, along with two alternate athletes, then compete at the state level for the right to attend the Daisy Nationals. Teams are responsible for their own travel costs and often secure sponsors who share in the pride of having a local team go to this prestigious match.</p>

        <p><b>-Shooting Education: Daisy Literally Wrote the Book on Shooting Education</b></p>
        <p>In 1955, Daisy wrote the first organized curriculum on shooting education. The lesson plan, which starts with gun safety instruction, has evolved over the years into Daisy's Shooting Education Ten Lesson Curriculum. The lesson plans include topics such as gun safety rules, types of firearms, safe carries, determining dominant eye, building a proper sight picture, shooting positions, range commands and more. Over the years, Daisy has teamed with the U.S. Junior Chambers of Commerce, 4-H Shooting Sports, the American Legion, the National Rifle Association, Royal Rangers, the National Guard Youth Marksmanship Program as well as scout troops, camps and church youth groups to provide instructional material, equipment and complete training kits. Daisy's ten-lesson shooting education curriculum has been adopted by most civic organizations to teach shooting safety and marksmanship skills.</p>
        <p>As with any sport, part of the fun is in competition, which is why Daisy's shooting safety and marksmanship education program also includes a competition facet. All across the country, in small classroom settings, young people are instructed on the proper handling of guns, shooting safety rules, shooting positions and marksmanship skills. Marksmanship teams, formed by these organizations, shoot weekly then compete on a local and state level. Only teams which compete and place in the top three spots in a state championship match are eligible to compete in Daisy National BB Gun Championship Match - which has been taking place since 1966. Typically, about 450 young people ages 8 to 15, qualify to compete in the 5-meter team BB gun competition annually. They shoot a muzzle-loaded single-shot BB gun, the Daisy AVANTI Champion Model 499. The Daisy AVANTI Champion Model 499 is billed as the most accurate BB gun in the world. They will shoot in four positions: prone, standing, sitting, and kneeling and be scored on a Safety Exam in order to qualify for individual and team medals.</p>
        <p>As a point of clarification, Daisy does not certify state matches or sponsor BB teams. If you're interested in starting a BB gun team, there are many places to get information and help. Try the National Rifle Association Airgun Program (<a href="https://homeairgun.nra.org/">homeairgun.nra.org</a>), the Civilian Marksmanship Program (<a href="https://thecmp.org/">thecmp.org</a>), the American Legion (<a href="https://www.legion.org/">legion.org</a>), the Junior Olympic Shooting Program (<a href="https://usashooting.org/">usashooting.org</a>) or your local County Extension Agent to get information on your local 4-H Club Shooting Sports Programs. It's also important to note that to qualify for the Daisy Nationals, state contests are not required to be NRA-sanctioned. NRA-sanctioned matches are required if you're interested in having your shooting records recorded at the national level.</p>
